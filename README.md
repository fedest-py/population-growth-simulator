# population-growth-simulator

This Python program models the exponential growth of a population over three time periods using the formula: 
P = P₀ * e^(rt)

Where:
P is the final population
P₀ is the initial population
e is the Euler's number
r is the annual growth rate
t is time (years)


The program:
1. Prompts the user to enter the initial population.
2. Repeats the growth process three times, asking for:
   - A time period (in years)
   - A relative growth rate (as a percentage)
3. Updates the population each time using the exponential growth formula.
4. Prints the final population value.

## Concepts Demonstrated:
- Mathematical modeling
- User input handling
- Using the `math` module
- Floating point calculations
